📖 About

This repository is a collection of small front-end projects — each one focused on a specific UI pattern, animation technique, or layout concept. They're designed to be bite-sized, self-contained, and perfect for learning or reusing in bigger projects.

From blurry loading screens to expanding cards, rotating navbars to spider-man themed loaders — each project explores something fun and practical. I'll keep adding more as I go! 🚀
